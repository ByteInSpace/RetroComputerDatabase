# RetroComputerDatabase

Developed in SpringBoot with Angular Frontend it provides information about RetroComputer and will after finish be deployed as a regular Webapplication.

EDIT: at the moment the GUI will be created with Thymeleaf. I need still to work out a bit about Angular. Well, I am the backend guy usually....

I prepared it this way, as I would later develop further applications to access it: an Android Client and a Webapplication for handling my collection.

Yes, I know, I could this in PHP too, but I wanted to use Spring for it ;-)
